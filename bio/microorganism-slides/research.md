## Slide 1:

- [x] Description of disease.

Anthrax is a rare bacterial disease that occurs naturally in soil and that
spreads through spores. It is common in livestock and kills by releasing toxins
into the tissues and the blood which ultimately lead to death.

- [x] Is the disease caused by a bacterium, virus, protist, or fungi?

It is caused by a bacterium.

- [x] Scientific name of microorganism

The scientific name for Anthrax is *Bacillus anthracis*.

- [x] What is the shape of organism?

The anthrax bacteria are rod shaped.

- [x] Who does it affect?

Anthrax can infect anyone who comes in contact with the spores but, it is much
more common in livestock populations that humans. Cases are more common in parts
of the world where people come in contact with infected animal products and thus
is very uncommon in the United States but is more prevalent in agricultural
regions.

- [x] What part of the body is targeted?

Anthrax affects which ever part of the body it comes into contact with. If you
are infected from a cut, it will affect the skin around the wound. If you
breathe in spores it will attack your lungs. Anthrax can cause breathing
problems and skin ulcers that arise from the toxins that the bacteria releases.
There are three stages of anthrax infection which are distinguished from the
levels of toxin released by the bacteria.

## Slide 2: How is it contracted?

- [x] How can you give/spread it?

Anthrax is spread by anthrax spores that enter the body in some way. Anthrax is
not contagious. It is most common to have cutaneous anthrax (entering via the
skin) and it is the least severe form. When an animal dies of anthrax, its body
releases spores in the area that stay for a very long time. Once an organism is
infected with anthrax, they are not contagious until they die, and their body
releases the anthrax spores.

- [x] Can you get it more than once?

An organism can be infected with anthrax more than once and routine vaccinations
are a very good preventative measure.

## Slide 3:

- [x] Symptoms External symptoms? (visible like rash)

If you have a cutaneous infection, anthrax will cause a skin ulcer at the
infection site. Otherwise, there are no visible external symptoms.

- [x] Internal symptoms (mentally or physically like malaise, headache)

For the most part, inhalation anthrax symptoms are flu-like but more severe.
(symptoms from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/symptoms/index.html) list.)
Fever and chills, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, confusion or dizziness,
cough, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains, headache, sweats (often drenching),
extreme tiredness, and body aches can all be present in anthrax cases.

## Slide 4:

- [x] Conventional treatment/ cure: How are the symptoms usually treated?

Anthrax is treated with extreme antibiotics but in cases of inhalation and
gastrointestinal anthrax, only 55% of people will survive even with treatment.

- [x] Is organism resistant?

Anthrax is not extremely resistant to antibiotics, but only two widely
antibiotics are effective against it, and once it reaches a certain level of
establishment in one's body, they are rather ineffective.

## Slide 5:

- [x] History: When was it first discovered?

Anthrax-like diseases have been recorded throughout history, but the first time
that the specific bacterium was categorized and given a name was in the mid
1800s. However, the physician Maret gave a medical account of anthrax in 1752.

- [x] Any major outbreaks/epidemics?

There have been outbreaks of diseases thought to be anthrax in early history.
The largest known outbreak of anthrax was in Sverdlovsk, Russia in 1979. A
Russian bioweapon research center misinstalled the air filters that morning,
resulting in anthrax being spewed from the building into the air. Of the 94
people know to have been infected, at least 64 died from inhalation anthrax.

- [x] Any interesting history?

Anthrax is thought to have caused the 5th plague during the Ten Plagues of Egypt
in the bible because of the references to livestock. In 2001 there was an attack
using anthrax in the United States where anthrax was put into envelopes and sent
to US Senators. Five people were killed.

- [x] Famous people who have died from it

No celebrities have died from anthrax.

- [x] How many people a year die from it

In the United States, there is no consistent annual deaths from anthrax.
Information on anthrax-related deaths in other countries is unreliable and is
estimated to be below 100.

## Slide 6: Question/Answer and Facts/Myths section

- [x] What are frequently asked questions with answers, need 4

1. Is anthrax contagious? No, anthrax can not be spread from person to person.
2. Is anthrax a bioweapon? Yes, anthrax has been used as a bioweapon in the
   past, and is on the US list of most dangerous bioweapons.
3. Am I at risk of anthrax? The general population in the US is not at any risk
   of anthrax. If you work in an animal-product mill, such as a wool mill or
   slaughterhouse, you are at a greater risk.
4. What is the fatality rate of anthrax? The fatality rate of anthrax depends on
   the kind of anthrax you have. The most common type cutaneous (on the skin)
   can be treated with a high success rate using antibiotics.

- [x] What are some common myths with the truth, need 4

1. Anthrax is a common in humans. Anthrax is in fact, very uncommon in humans
   and is much for prevalent in animals.
2. Anthrax is a fungus. No, anthrax is not a fungus. Although the infectious
   particles are called spores, this is a name used for a special kind of
   bacterial cell, not just a fungal cell.
3. Anthrax cannot be cured. There are treatments for all kinds of anthrax but,
   the success rates in later stages and in inhalation anthrax are low.
4. Anthrax is only acquired through the lungs. The most common form of anthrax
   is in the skin. Inhalation anthrax (anthrax of the lungs) is the least common
   way to contract anthrax.
