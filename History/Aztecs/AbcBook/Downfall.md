# Downfall

All empires end eventually (except China for some reason.) Many different causes can result in the downfall of an empire. In the Aztecs' case, that cause was Spanish Colonialism. A man named Hernán Cortés arrived from Spain in the year 1519. His arrival and decimation of the Aztec people and culture would result in the end of the empire in the following years.
