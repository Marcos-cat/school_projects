# Nopal

Nopal is the Spanish word for a prickly pear cactus, the type of cactus found in the region where the Aztecs lived. It comes from the Nahuatl word _nohpalli_, meaning cactus. Nopal was significant to the Aztecs because it was used for medicinal purposes and was the cactus that Huitzilopochtli told them they would find when the original Aztec people were looking for a place to settle.
