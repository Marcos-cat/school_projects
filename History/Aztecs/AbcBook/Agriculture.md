The Aztecs were very dependent on growing food to eat. The three major crops that constituted the majority of an Aztec's diet were maize (or corn), beans, and squash. These three native vegetables were the backbone of Aztec meals. They are known as the Three Sisters because, when grown together, they thrive. Beans need support which cornstalks provide. Corn absorbs nitrogen in soil while beans replenish it. Squash leaves shade the soil, keeping in moisture to hydrate the others.
