# Belgian Congo

## <https://www.historytoday.com/archive/contrarian/belgiums-heart-darkness>

Orchestrated by King Leopold II of Belgium, born 1835, died in 1909.
He convinced European powers to grant him a large piece of land in the Congo Basin.
He named the land The Congo Free State in 1885, a name that would prove to be very ironic.
This land was 76 times the size of Belgium.
The part of the land that proved to be very profitable for Leopold was the many rubber trees found in the Congo.
Leopold turned to the natives in the area --- the Congolese --- to harvest the rubber as slave laborers.
Villages were given quotas of rubber that had to be met with the threat of hostages being killed.
One of the most famous parts of this atrocity was stemmed from the rule that the Belgians who collected the rubber from the Congolese had limited bullets. To prove that they weren't wasting them on anything besides killing hostages, they were told to bring the severed hands of all the Congolese whom they shot. This resulted in a black market for severed hands, where many living Congolese were round up to have their hands chopped off, even when they had met their rubber quotas.
This was a disgusting crime against humanity committed by the Belgians and namely King Leopold II.
