## Opening Speech

My name is Achyuta Samanta, and I was born in a poor village in India called
Odisha in January of 1965. I am now 59 years old. At a young age, I recognized
that education was vital for children in order to lead successful lives. Since
then, it has been my goal to provide education to as many children as I could. I
have founded a number of schools in my quest to educate children from tribal
communities in India. So far, in the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences and
the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology over 115,000 children have been
educated, 80,000 of them attended the school entirely free of cost. These
children are now much more fit to succeed in life and in society because of this
boost that has been given to them. My actions have been widely recognized; I
have received over 50 national and international awards for my work in education
My actions have been widely recognized; I have received over 50 national and
international awards for my work in education.

I must remain in this balloon so that I can continue educating children that are
even less fortunate than I was. I need to continue to make the world a better
place for those who cannot afford education. Keep me in this balloon, not for
me, but for the children who need my help.
