# Introduction Paragraph

## Hook

Typically, programming includes English letters, and everyday words (if somewhat specialized.) But, some look more like this: `⍜⍘√(÷⊃⧻/+)-÷⊃⧻/+.`. What are these symbols, hieroglyphics!? In fact, this is a programming language called Uiua.

## Background Information

Programmers have had the comfort of the C-based languages for a long time. C is the language upon which many commonplace languages are built. It has a familiar curly-brace syntax and uses regular English characters for its function and variable names. But other languages exist unbeknownst to many that break the norms that many don't even realize can be broken. Uiua is one such language.

## Thesis Statement

The combination of paradigms in Uiua enables a problem-solving mindset.
