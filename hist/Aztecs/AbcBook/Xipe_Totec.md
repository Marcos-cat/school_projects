# Xipe Totec

Xipe Totec was the Aztec god representing the East. He encompassed the concept
of the life → death → rebirth cycle which was a prominent concept in Aztec
culture. He was the connection between replenishing (agriculture) and
destruction (warfare.) His name means 'The Flayed One' because in Aztec
mythology he flayed himself to give food to humans. This is an analogy to how
corn seeds lose their outer shell and how snakes shed their skin.
