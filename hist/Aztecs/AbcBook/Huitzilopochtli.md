# Huitzilopochtli

Huitzilopochtli was the patron gods of the Aztecs and represented the cardinal
direction South. He was also the patron of their capital city, Tenochtitlan.
Before the Aztec empire rose to power, it was Huitzilopochtli who guided the
Aztecs to settle in Lake Texcoco and establish the city of Tenochtitlan, a
choice that would prove very significant.
