# King

The Aztec Empire was a religious monarchy. This means that there was a king who
had the blood of the gods, and the government was run by other priests and
religious figures. The king or emperor at the time of the Spanish Conquest was
Moctezuma II (his Nahuatl name was Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin.) When Hernán Cortés
overtook the Aztec Empire, he did so by kidnapping Moctezuma which caused chaos.
