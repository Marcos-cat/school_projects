# Quetzalcoatl

Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec god of knowledge and the patron of Aztec priesthood.
The name Quetzalcoatl is made of two parts. Quetzal-, meaning feathered and
-coatl, meaning snake. Logically, he was often represented as a flying feathered
serpent. Statues of his head were commonly carved into religious buildings such
as temples. The largest flying animal ever - a pterosaur called Quetzalcoatlus -
was named after this god.
