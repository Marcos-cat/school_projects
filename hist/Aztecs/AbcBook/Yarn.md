# Yarn

Yarn and thus weaving played a significant role in Aztec culture. Yarn was
typically made from cotton that the Aztecs grew rather than from animal fur.
Skilled craftsmen would then weave yarn into elaborate designs and clothing for
special religious ceremonies. Thick cotton fabrics were also used make armor for
men going off into war.
