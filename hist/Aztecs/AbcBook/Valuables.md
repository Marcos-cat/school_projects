# Valuables

Gold was one of the most valuable Aztec possessions. It was very abundant and
significant to the Aztec empire. It was called _teocuitlatl_ in Nahuatl. This
translates directly to 'excrement of the gods'. They believed that the gold they
found was the sweat of the sun as he exerted himself rising every morning. Only
people with permission of the emperor were allowed to own gold, primarily in the
form of jewelry.
