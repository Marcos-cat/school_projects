The Aztecs - like any culture - had free time to fill. Some activities that the
Aztecs engaged in included dancing, playing music, hunting and fishing, and
playing board games. The Aztecs had a board game called _patolli_. It was a two
player strategic game where each player tried to remove all of their pieces from
the board before the other could.
