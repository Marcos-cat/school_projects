# Polytheism

The word 'polytheism' means to believe in multiple, separate gods. Many
religions such as Hinduism and Shintoism are polytheistic. The Aztec religion
was polytheistic as well. The Aztecs worshiped four principal gods, each
representing a cardinal direction. Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, Huitzilopochtli,
and Quetzalcoatl representing North, East, South, and West respectively.
