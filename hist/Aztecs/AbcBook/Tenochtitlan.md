# Island of Tenochtitlan

Tenochtitlan is the floating island-city that served as the capital and
birthplace of the Aztec Empire. The Aztec people settled here upon seeing an
eagle perched atop a cactus while eating a rattlesnake, the exact sign that the
god Huitzilopochtli told them they would find in the place they were to live. At
its height Tenochtitlan had two hundred thousand residents and covered 5 square
miles.
