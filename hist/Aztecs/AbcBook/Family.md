# Family

The Aztec family structure was very important to their culture. Men were to
marry around twenty years old and women at sixteen. Women were tasked with the
more homely responsibilities and the men were supposed to take on a job to
support the family. Children were taught many everyday tasks and were legally
required to attend to school once they were fifteen.
