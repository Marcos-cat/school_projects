# Language

The Aztecs spoke a language called Nahuatl (pronounced in English like
NAH-waht-uhl.) A very similar variant of the language called Modern Nahuatl is
still spoken in some parts of Mexico today. Classical Nahuatl did not have an
alphabet, however. Similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics, each word was represented
by a picture or group of pictures. The written form of the language was
primarily inscribed in stone, although it was rarely written in documents called
_amatl_ or _amoxtli_ and later in codices when the Spanish made them document
their way of life.
