# Money

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as a form of uniform currency. One cocoa bean could
buy a large tomato, eight could buy a rabbit, and a hundred could buy a turkey
hen. These values were constant throughout the Aztec Empire, much like how a
dollar has roughly the same spending power in different parts of the United
States.
