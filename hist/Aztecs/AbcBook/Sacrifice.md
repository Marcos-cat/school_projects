# Sacrifice

One of the most famous parts of Aztec history was the practice of human
sacrifice. The Aztecs believed that to keep the gods happy they must sacrifice
human life to them. When the Aztecs went to war, they would attempt to capture
as many enemies as possible, careful not to waste precious human life. Then once
the enemies were in the hands of the Aztecs they were sacrificed to the gods in
various religious ceremonies.
