# War

The Aztecs are well-know for their ability to conduct warfare. They mastered
many techniques such as ambushing their opponents as well as spying on them for
intel. The Aztecs also had complex military ranks which you climbed based on the
number of captives you brought back from the battlefield. Every rank had
different attire, your clothing, weapons, and even hairstyle were changed
according to your rank.
