# Chinampas

Chinampas were crucial to sustaining the Aztec Empire. A chinampa is a small plot of land created by putting up posts in water, building walls up to the surface of the water, and then filling in the box with soil. These buildings provide extremely fertile farmland where farmers can grow corn, beans, and squash with a very plentiful harvest. Chinampas were often separated by wide canals so that canoes could easily travel throughout the city.
