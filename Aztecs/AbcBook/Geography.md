# Geography

The Aztec Empire was located in what is now modern-day Mexico, in fact the word Mexico comes from Nahuatl. The Aztecs controlled the majority of the land from the twenty-fourth parallel (Durango Mexico) to the Yucat√°n Peninsula. This region is known as the Valley of Mexico because it is surrounded by mountains and lakes. This caused a very temperate, warm climate which the Aztecs thrived in.
