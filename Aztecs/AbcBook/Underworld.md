# Underworld

The Aztecs believed in an afterlife that souls were transported to after they die. This land was called Mictlan and was believed to be under the earth. They journey was strenuous for the people traveling and took four years (the time that it took for a body to decompose.) There were nine levels that the dead had to pass through before completing their journey.
