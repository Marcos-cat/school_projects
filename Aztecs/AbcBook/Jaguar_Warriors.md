# Jaguar Warriors

The Aztecs were known for their elaborate military uniforms. A key example of this are the uniforms of the Jaguar Warriors. The Jaguar Warriors were the highest, most elite military rank that a commoner without a noble bloodline could wish to achieve. The predominant feature of their attire was the pelt and head of a jaguar that was worn into battle.
